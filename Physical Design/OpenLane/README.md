# OpenLane Configuration – 8-bit ALU

This directory contains the **OpenLane configuration** used to perform the **RTL-to-GDSII physical design flow** for the 8-bit ALU.

OpenLane is an open-source, automated ASIC flow that integrates multiple tools to execute synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), routing, and signoff.


##  Contents

- `config.json` – OpenLane design configuration file for the ALU

##  Configuration Overview

The `config.json` file defines the **key design parameters** required to run the OpenLane flow, including:

- Top-level design name
- RTL source file(s)
- Clock definition and timing constraint
- Process Design Kit (PDK)
- Standard cell library
- Basic floorplanning and placement targets

A **minimal configuration** was intentionally used to focus on understanding the standard RTL-to-GDS flow, while allowing OpenLane to handle detailed optimization through its default settings.


##  Tools & Technology

- **Flow:** OpenLane
- **PDK:** SkyWater Sky130 (`sky130A`)
- **Standard Cell Library:** `sky130_fd_sc_hd`
- **Timing Constraint:** Defined using clock port and period in `config.json`


##  Role in the Design Flow

The OpenLane flow performs the following major steps:

1. Logic synthesis and optimization
2. Floorplanning and power planning
3. Standard-cell placement
4. Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
5. Global and detailed routing
6. Design rule and timing checks
7. Final GDSII generation

The outputs generated by OpenLane are documented separately in the **physical design results** directory.


##  Outcome

Using this configuration, the 8-bit ALU was successfully taken from **verified RTL to final GDSII**, with clean routing and timing closure achieved under the Sky130 process.
