# Logic Synthesis – 8-bit ALU

This directory contains the **logic synthesis artifacts** for the 8-bit ALU design.
Logic synthesis converts the verified RTL into a **gate-level netlist**, serving as the bridge between RTL design and physical implementation.



##  Contents

- `yosys_script.ys` – Yosys synthesis script used to synthesize the ALU RTL
- `alu_netlist.v` – Final synthesized gate-level netlist generated by Yosys
- `synthesis_summary.txt` – Summary of synthesis configuration and results
- `fig4.5.png` and `fig4.6.png` - Visual evidence of synthesis execution and statistics


##  Tool & Environment

- **Logic Synthesis Tool:** Yosys  
- **Execution Environment:** MSYS2 (Windows)

MSYS2 was used as a Unix-like environment to run Yosys on Windows.  
The synthesis process itself is tool-driven and independent of the operating system.



##  Synthesis Flow

The following steps were performed during logic synthesis:

1. Verilog RTL was read into Yosys
2. Generic logic synthesis and optimization were performed
3. A **generic gate-level netlist** was generated

Technology-specific mapping to Sky130 standard cells was handled later as part of the **OpenLane physical design flow**.



## Synthesis Evidence

The following screenshots are provided as proof of successful synthesis:

### Yosys Terminal Output

### Netlist Statistics

## Outcome

- RTL successfully synthesized into a generic gate-level netlist
- Netlist validated using Yosys statistics
- Final netlist used as input to the OpenLane RTL-to-GDSII flow

Intermediate synthesis files (e.g., `synth.v`) are intentionally excluded to keep the repository clean and focused.
